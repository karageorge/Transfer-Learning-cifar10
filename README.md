# Description:

baseline CNN versus a transfer learning CNN

1) baseline CNN: input shape = (32,32,3), 2 convolutional layers, 2 max pooling layers, 1 fully connected layer
2) transer learning model: input shape = (96,96,3), pre-trained model = MobileNetV2, pre-trained weights = ImageNet, trained layers: 1 fully connected layer
